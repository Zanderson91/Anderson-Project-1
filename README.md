Movie selector where the user can select criteria and get a list of movies that contain the selected criteria to watch. The cure for the "I don't care, whatever you want to watch" debacle.

With the "What to Watch" site, simply enter your parameters and BOOM crisis averted. What to Watch will take your selections and return a short list of Movies and/or TV Shows with your selected criteria. You no longer have to waste time thinking about a movie/TV-Show simply select your response and now you have a list of available titles within your search criteria! Don't like the 4 that were chosen for you, simply click again or change your parameters and you will be given a new list to choose from. Feeling risky?? Try clicking the Unique Suggestions button for some truly unique suggestions....
